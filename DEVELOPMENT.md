# Development

## Project Setup

- [Build a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) Blazor app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hybrid/tutorials/wpf?view=aspnetcore-9.0)
- [Setup Routing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hybrid/routing?view=aspnetcore-9.0&pivots=wpf#get-or-set-a-path-for-initial-navigation)
- [Add MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/getting-started/installation#online-playground)
- [Add Microsoft Win32 API C# Source Generator](https://github.com/microsoft/cswin32)
  - [Parent Project: win32metadata](https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata)
  - [Getting Started](https://microsoft.github.io/CsWin32/docs/getting-started.html)
    - [Workaround for WPF PackageReference and source generators bug](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32/issues/7)
  - List desired Native Methods in `NativeMethods.txt`
    - **Exported method name** (e.g. CreateFile). This may include the A or W suffix, where applicable. This may be qualified with a namespace but is only recommended in cases of ambiguity, which CsWin32 will prompt where appropriate. 
    - **A macro name** (e.g. HRESULT_FROM_WIN32). These are generated into the same class with extern methods. Macros must be hand-authored into CsWin32, so let us know if you want to see a macro added. 
    - **A namespace** to generate all APIs from (e.g. Windows.Win32.Storage.FileSystem would search the metadata for all APIs within that namespace and generate them). 
    - **Module name followed by `.*`** to generate all methods exported from that module (e.g. `Kernel32.*`). 
    - **The name of a struct, enum, constant or interface** to generate. This may be qualified with a namespace but is only recommended in cases of ambiguity, which CsWin32 will prompt where appropriate. 
    - **A prefix shared by many constants**, followed by `*`, to generate all constants that share that prefix (e.g. `ALG_SID_MD*`). 
    - **A comment** (i.e. any line starting with `//`) or white space line, which will be ignored.
  - Debug:
    - Check generated files at:
      - `<Project>`  
        - `Dependencies`  
          - `.NET <X.Y>`
            - `Source Generators`
              - `Microsoft.Windows.CsWin32.SourceGenerator.CsWin32SourceGenerator`
