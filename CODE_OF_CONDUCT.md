Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any unacceptable behavior.
