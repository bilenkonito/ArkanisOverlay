## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arkanis-overlay.git
   cd arkanis-overlay
   ```

2. Create a new branch from the latest `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/123-new-feature
   ```

3. Install [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) and verify:
   ```bash
   dotnet --version
   ```

---

## Branching & Workflow

We use a structured branch naming convention:

* Prefixes: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, etc.
* Branches must begin with the related issue ID.

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/123-resolve-login-bug
```

Branches prefixed with `release/` are protected and reserved for maintainers preparing official releases.

All changes are merged into `main` after review and CI validation.

---

## Semantic Commits

Please use [semantic commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep the history readable and informative.

**Format**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

**Examples**:

```
feat(server): add new API endpoint for overlay config
fix(domain): resolve null ref in session manager
chore(build): update CI pipeline to .NET 8
```

Reference related issues in the commit body or footer when applicable.
Add body text for more context if needed.

---

## Code Style

* Code formatting is enforced via `.editorconfig`.
* Development is done primarily in JetBrains Rider. ReSharper-friendly changes are appreciated.
* Nullable reference types are enabled solution-wide.

---

## Testing

To run all tests locally:

```bash
dotnet test
```

**Guidelines**:

* Backend contributions (non-UI) should include tests where applicable.
* Follow existing test organization under `Arkanis.Overlay.*.UnitTests` and `Arkanis.Overlay.*.IntegrationTests`.
* You can read more in the testing-dedicated [README.md](./tests/README.md).

---

## Pull Requests

* All PRs must be reviewed by a maintainer before merging.
* Squashing commits is discouraged; we prefer maintaining full commit history.
* Reference the issue ID in your PR description with [closing keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if applicable.
* Use the `WIP:` prefix for work-in-progress PRs, and remove it when ready for a review.
* Target the `main` branch, and ensure all CI checks pass before requesting a review.

---

## Issue Tracking

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs, possible enhancements, and feature requests.

* Opening an issue before submitting a PR is encouraged.
* Look for helpful labels like:
    * `good first issue`
    * `help wanted`

---

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* `Arkanis.Overlay.Host.Desktop` – WPF host app
* `Arkanis.Overlay.Host.Server` – ASP.NET Core backend server
* `Arkanis.Overlay.Common`, `Components`, `Domain`, `Infrastructure`, etc. – shared libraries
* `Arkanis.Overlay.External.*` – integration with external systems

Use scoped commit messages where applicable, e.g.:

```
feat(server): add configuration endpoint
feat(external): add client SDK for external API of example.com
fix(components): resolve null reference in overlay component
```

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions validates all pull requests with:

* Build verification
* Test execution

CI runs on both internal and external (forked) PRs.

---

## Maintainers & Permissions

* All changes must go through a pull request, even for maintainers.
* Direct commits to `main` or `release/*` are restricted.
* In exceptional cases (e.g., emergencies), maintainers may bypass this process.

Long-term contributors may be invited to join the maintainer team.
