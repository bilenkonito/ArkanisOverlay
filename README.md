## üöÄ What is Arkanis Overlay?

**Arkanis Overlay** is a usability-focused, in-game companion overlay for **Star Citizen**.
It aims to provide players with direct access to essential tools and information without having to leave the game or juggle external websites.
Inspired by the *[RatScanner](https://ratscanner.com/)* project from the Tarkov community,
this project is built with a strong focus on reliability, extensibility, and community collaboration.

The overlay is currently in **active development** and driven by a clear mission:
> **Minimize friction, maximize immersion.**

---

## ‚ú® Key User Features (MVP)

- **In-Game Search Tool**
  ‚Äî Find general and commonly-needed game information fast ‚Äî no more alt-tabbing to search websites.

- **Integrated Community Data**
  ‚Äî Seamlessly connected with the [UEX Corporation][uex] and other community tools _(in the future)_
  to enrich in-game decision-making.

- **Automatic Startup**
  ‚Äî Launches automatically when you start Windows and Star Citizen, so you‚Äôre always ready to go.

- **Installer & Auto-updater**
  ‚Äî A self-updating installer that ensures you always have the latest version of the overlay.

## ü§ù Community Focus

- **Community-Driven Development**
  ‚Äî Built in collaboration with players and devs who actively use and shape the tools.

- **Open Source**
  ‚Äî The project is open source, allowing anyone to contribute, suggest features, and report bugs.
  We welcome all contributions, whether big or small.
  Check out the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get involved
  and let us know you are up for the challenge by joining our [Discord server][arkanis-discord]
  or opening [a new discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/ArkanisCorporation/ArkanisOverlay/discussions/categories/ideas).

## üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Microsoft **.NET 8**
  ‚Äî The application is built using the latest .NET technologies, ensuring a modern and efficient (developer) experience.

- **WPF-Hosted Blazor Windows App**
  ‚Äî Built in C# using modern UI technologies for smooth performance and simple extensibility.

- **ASP.NET Core Server**
  ‚Äî The backend is built on ASP.NET Core, providing a robust and scalable foundation for future features.

> [!TIP]
> You can check out the in-browser demo of the overlay at [overlay.arkanis.cc][overlay-demo]!
> It features an identical UI and functionality as the in-game version, just without the game integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

This section provides a quick overview of how to install and use the Arkanis Overlay application.

### Installation

Follow these steps to install the Arkanis Overlay application on your Windows system:

1. **Download** an installer for the latest (stable) release from:
    - the [Overlay in-browser demo page][overlay-demo]
    - or the [Arkanis Overlay homepage][overlay-homepage]
    - or the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ArkanisCorporation/ArkanisOverlay/releases)
2. **Run the installer** to automatically install the application with a self-updater.
   <br>Windows may prompt you with a UAC (User Account Control) dialog to confirm the installation.
   This is a standard security feature of Windows to ensure that you trust the application you are installing.
   See the screenshots below for reference.
   After confirming, the application will be installed to `%LocalAppData%/ArkanisOverlay`.

   |             Installer - Windows UAC Step 1              |             Installer - Windows UAC Step 2              |
   |:-------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|
   | ![UAC, Step 1](docs/images/Windows_UAC-DialogOnly1.png) | ![UAC, Step 2](docs/images/Windows_UAC-DialogOnly2.png) |

3. **Launch the application** from the Start Menu or by double-clicking the desktop shortcut.
   Both are named `Arkanis Overlay`.

### Application Behavior

Once launched, the application runs in the **Windows system tray**.
It does not display a window by default.
From the tray icon, you can open the **preferences dialog** or exit the application entirely.

### Overlay Activation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The in-game overlay can be opened using the default keyboard shortcut: `Left Alt + Left Shift + S`.

The shortcut can be customized through the **preferences dialog**, allowing you to set a key combination that best suits your needs.

### Preferences and Configuration

The preferences dialog is accessible either from the **system tray icon** or directly within the **overlay interface** itself.

Within the preferences dialog, you currently can:

- Enable or disable automatic launching of the application when Windows starts.
- Choose whether the overlay application should automatically exit when Star Citizen is closed.
- Customize the keyboard shortcut used to activate the overlay.
- Adjust other application-specific settings related to appearance and behavior.

## üí° Philosophy

Star Citizen is vast ‚Äî and at times, frustratingly so.
Especially for citizens newly embarking on their journey in Stanton and beyond.
**Arkanis Overlay** doesn't aim to change the game, but to make the *experience better*.
For everyone.
It‚Äôs your always-on wingman ‚Äî helpful, seamless, and never in the way.

Key principles:

- **Reliable UX**: The overlay *must* be stable. The game has enough bugs already.
- **Incremental growth**: Release early, improve often.
- **No exploits**: This project will *never* include cheats, automation, or game-breaking features.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Status

> Project Lead: [FatalMerlin](https://github.com/FatalMerlin)<br>
> Language: C#<br>
> Frameworks: **WPF** and **WebView2** for the Windows client, **Blazor**

Currently developed in bursts due to time constraints (because, you know‚Ä¶ real life).
We are now a small dev team ‚Äî progress is slow but deliberate.
We are looking for fellow motivated and able citizens to join us on this journey.

> [!NOTE]
> Have you found a bug?
> Would you like contribute to the project?
> We are always looking for help with feature development, application testing, and better UI/UX design.

> [an issue](https://github.com/ArkanisCorporation/ArkanisOverlay/issues/new/choose)
> or contact [@FatalMerlin](https://discord.com/users/174617873182883841) directly.

‚Äî just like the developers and the users of this tool.
We aim to embody the same spirit: discovery, utility, and frontier innovation.
